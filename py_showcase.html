            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p >
                At the start of the year, I embarked on a project to create a basic quiz in Python as part of my NCEA assessment.
                 The goal was to develop an engaging program that would test users on general knowledge questions, making the learning
                  experience both fun and educational. I began by researching different types of quiz formats and decided on a multiple-choice 
                  approach, which I felt would be accessible to a wide audience.After outlining the structure, I set up a series of questions, 
                  each accompanied by four answer options. I used Python's input functions to prompt users for their answers, ensuring the 
                  interface was clear and straightforward. As the user progressed through the quiz, the program collected their responses and 
                  maintained a running score, giving instant feedback after each question. This involved utilizing control flow statements, which
                   helped reinforce my understanding of loops and conditionals.Once the user completed the quiz, the program calculated the total 
                   score and provided a summary of their performance, along with encouragement for their efforts. This project was not only a
                    practical application of the coding concepts I was learning but also an excellent opportunity to enhance my problem-solving 
                    skills. Overall, creating the quiz was a rewarding experience that deepened my appreciation for programming while fulfilling 
                    the requirements of my assessment.
