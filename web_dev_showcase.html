                In July, I embarked on a project to design a personal portfolio website using Adobe XD as part of my NCEA assessment.
                 The goal was to create a visually engaging platform to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements, while also 
                 exploring the principles of UI/UX design. I started by researching various portfolio layouts and decided on a clean,
                  minimalist design that would be accessible and user-friendly.After establishing the initial wireframes, I created multiple 
                  sections, such as "About Me" and "Projects," each featuring unique layouts, typography, and visual elements. Adobe XD allowed 
                  me to build interactive prototypes with smooth transitions and micro-interactions, making the design both intuitive and
                   aesthetically pleasing. I paid close attention to color schemes, spacing, and alignment to ensure the site would provide a 
                   cohesive visual experience.Once the design was complete, I shared the interactive prototype for feedback and used the input 
                   to refine elements such as navigation, content placement, and overall flow. This project was not only a practical application 
                   of the UI/UX design concepts I was learning, but also a chance to experiment with new features in Adobe XD, like auto-animate
                    and component states.Overall, designing the portfolio website in Adobe XD was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding
                     of web design principles and helped me develop a polished, professional product for my NCEA assessment.
